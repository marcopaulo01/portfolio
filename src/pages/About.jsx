                <h2>My Journey in Code</h2>
                <p>Hi, I'm Marco. My path began in financial management, but it was my stint 
                    at a government agency in the Philippines that unveiled a fascination for 
                    databases, especially SQL. This discovery led me to a pivotal decisionâ€”to 
                    delve into the realm of software engineering. Today, I'm passionately n
                    avigating the world of code, merging my financial expertise with newfound 
                    tech skills to craft innovative solutions that bridge the gap between data 
                    and software.
                </p>
                <p>Outside the realm of software and technology, my life finds balance and joy 
                    in the moments spent with family and loved ones. Cherishing these connections 
                    brings depth and meaning to my journey, grounding me amidst the dynamic world 
                    of code. Engaging in heartfelt conversations and creating lasting memories 
                    with those closest to me is where I find my truest sense of fulfillment. 
                    These moments of connection remind me of the importance of balance and 
                    perspective in both personal and professional spheres.
